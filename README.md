# Docx reader

This is desktop app built with [Tauri](https://tauri.studio) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). You can open .docx files in it. Although many features are missing, like font, color, editing, etc, it opens documents ~3x faster than word.

## Features

- Bold, underline, highlighting, font size
- Outline

## Why Tauri?

Tauri is basically a less developed [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), but with much better performance. The fact that it uses [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in the backend allows it to parse the docx files fast.

## Why Svelte?

My point of Vue is that Svelte is more Reactive, and it's easier to Express my ideas. I can see the Angle of it being a pretty new framework, but I think it's the Next big thing, and will probably become the Backbone of web development.
